  <p>How many photos will we get?
The amount of photos you receive depends on the package you get. Look at my wedding and portrait collections for more information.

Are all the photos you give me processed?
Everything you receive on your USB drive is fully processed.

Do I get the rights to all the images?
Yes! Once I finish editing the images from your session, I deliver a disc to you. You then OWN the rights to these images and can print them for personal use only and are able to post them on facebook, twitter, instagram, or your preferred social media site. All I ask is that you do not crop, add filters, change colors, or alter any of the images. I do offer print options, so if you are overwhelmed and have no idea where to print, I would be happy to do it for you! :)
